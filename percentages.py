# I need to generate 500 lines of data
# Each line of data will represent a patient. Each value will represent if they are 
#     experiencing a specific symptom or not. There will also be numerical values
#     for the categories that require we know how many of something they have i.e. 
#     (parents with disease)
# I am going to need to build a loop that will go through and generate either a value for each
#     of the symptoms.
